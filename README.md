BearOS kernel
===============

BearOS, an ``x86-64-bit`` kernel.
Please read the ``sr/REQ.md``, it shows the minimum and maximum requirements for the kernel.
If you want to contribute, you can read the ``LICENSE.md`` file, where the license topic is located.

Something important to clarify is that all (or most) of the file comments are in Spanish, so you can use your trusted translator to read the code perfectly.

On line ``21 (in the file: kernel.c)``, there is an important comment that clarifies something. (I made this comment in order to make it English.)

This kernel will be constantly updated, but when the version is "complete" a GitHub ISSUE will be released where the . iso will be available for download (actually, it weighs nothing, much less at 16/18 MB, well, most of it)
