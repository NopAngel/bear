## About

**BearOS** is a kernel created by **NopAngel**. This kernel is designed for experienced programmers, providing tools for the job, with a simple, comfortable, and minimalist style that makes everything much easier.

However, it may contain bugs; this kernel is still in development and is not yet finished.

## Building

To compile the BearOS code you will need to follow these steps:

* Step 1, Clone the repository:
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/NopAngel/bear.git ./ # Select the PATH
```

* Step 2, Compile the code:
To compile BearOS code, you will need to have installed: GCC, NASM, QEMU (or some other virtual machine) and LD
```bash
> make compile && make iso #  This will generate an ISO for you to run.
```


* Step 3, Try the kernel:  **Here you can use ANY virtual machine to run it, IT IS NOT RECOMMENDED TO RUN IT ON A REAL COMPUTER, since the kernel is not prepared for that.**
