How to compile:


					Windows:
						On Windows I recommend you do it with VMBox, or VMware, since Windows has many problems, my personal 
						recommendation is to use a virtual machine, or use WSL2 (But, it will still give you problems)

					Linux:
						On Linux you just have to install: grub, gcc and g++, nasm and QEMU

					macOS:
						I don't have a macOS to test the operating system, and I don't know how it works, but from my experience I can say it's the same with Linux.
