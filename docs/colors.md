# Bear COLORS

With this operating system you can make 'customs' messages (only RED, GREEN AND BLUE color), since this supports VGA

There are 3 colors:

```bash
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+
	| RED | GREEN  |  BLUE |
	+---+---+---+---+---+---+
```

#### How do I make a custom message?

To display a custom message in a certain color you can do so with this command:
```bash
> print hello, world jeje
```

But if you want to display it in red, green or blue you have to put it like this:
```bash
> print_red hi
> print_blue hi
> print_green hi
```
