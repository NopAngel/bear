BearOS kernel
===============

BearOS, an ``x86-64-bit`` kernel.
Please read the ``sr/REQ.md``, it shows the minimum and maximum requirements for the kernel.
If you want to contribute, you can read the ``LICENSE.md`` file, where the license topic is located.

This kernel will be constantly updated, but when the version is "complete" a GitHub ISSUE will be released where the . iso will be available for download (actually, it weighs nothing, much less at 16/18 MB, well, most of it)
