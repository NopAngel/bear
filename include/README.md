BearOS - Drivers and Libreries
==============================

This complete file is created in case you want to create a BearOS modification, for example: BearOS with GUI, or some other modification. These folders also contain very important things, e.g.:

- VGA drivers, APM system, USB drivers, etc.

And also, a complete BearOS library that allows you to create your own BearOS or some BearOS modification (with credits to BearOS).
