Hello! This is a reference article about the minimum (and recommended) requirements for the operating system.


Minimum requirement:                    It should be noted that with these requirements you will be able to go to 60 fps (because, yes, it is limited to those FPS to avoid problems):

 - Ram: 30 MB.

 - Storage: 2 GB

 - Graphics: VGA (for 800x600)

Recommended requirements:

 - RAM: 4 GB (or more)

 - Storage: 10 GB ( or more for additional software, updates, and file storage. )

 - Graphics: HDMI (for 1920x1080)



Installation Media: A USB port or DVD drive is required to boot the installation media




I would like to emphasize that you can also run it on any virtual machine (you must configure it to x86-64 bits).
